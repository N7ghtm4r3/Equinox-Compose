/**
 * A singleton object that helps to maintain a weak reference to the current [Activity].
 * This is useful to avoid memory leaks by preventing strong references to an Activity.
 *
 * The weak reference ensures that the Activity can be garbage collected when no longer in use,
 * preventing holding onto the Activity object longer than necessary.
 *
 * # Sample
 *
 * Initialize it in your MainActivity.kt class
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
 *
 *     /**
 *      * {@inheritDoc}
 *      *
 *      * If your ComponentActivity is annotated with [ContentView], this will
 *      * call [setContentView] for you.
 *      */
 *     @CallSuper
 *     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
 *         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
 *
 *         ...
 *
 *         // attach the activity
 *         ContextActivityProvider.setCurrentActivity(this)
 *
 *         ...
 *
 *     }
 *
 * ```
 *
 * Use it in composable methods
 *
 *  ```kotlin
 *  @Composable
 *  fun SomeComposable() {
 *      val activity = ContextActivityProvider.getCurrentActivity()
 *  }
 *
 * ```
